Problem Statement
------------------

The problem statement is to create new technology or to modify existing to help cities better predict and/or prepare for natural disasters. 

IDEA
-----

Developing an app dedicated to disaster management. The app would be able to help the user to communicate an alert message and notify others regarding the situation. The major features involved in the app are:
1. Application would transmit an alert message to the emergency contacts mentioned by the user and the application server.        Along with it, the GPS location of the user would be transmitted. The motivation behind this is that during the disastrous situation, the person got stuck in a situation in which person would barely able to move or do anything. The activation of the app would inform the emergency contacts regarding the situation. The Activation of the app would quick and simple using descretely distinguishable gesture detectable by motion sensor or by opening the app and quick authentication. 
2. Application would include another communication protocol in which the emergency contact could send the activation permission, which if not acknowledged by the user in specified time would activate the app and send the user's location.            Motivation is that during a disastrous situation sometimes the person gets incapacitated. During that situation, the mobile device would help to track the position and situation of the person.
3. The application server would alert all the users in the locality regarding the disaster. An emergency message would be sent to all the nearby users which would alarm them regarding the situation. This server response could be generated by the emergency messages received from multiple users or by administrator (after receiving disaster predication message from some other authorities). This will help to evacuate the area and to reduce the casualties. 

This application will be quite helpful in management of disasterous scenarios like earthquake, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunami etc.
